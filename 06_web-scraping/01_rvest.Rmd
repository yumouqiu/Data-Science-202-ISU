# Web Scraping with R


## The `rvest` package

`read_html` gets *all* the information from a URL

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(rvest)
url <- "https://www.the-numbers.com/weekend-box-office-chart"
html <- read_html(url)
html
```

## Get a *table* from an online source

`html_table` extracts all tables from the sourced html into a list of data frames:

```{r}
tables <- html %>% html_table(fill=TRUE)
length(tables)
```
## Lists

- are most general form of objects in R
- `length()` accesses the number of items in a list
- `[[ ]]` accesses each item

```{r}
dim(tables[[1]])
dim(tables[[2]])

head(tables[[2]])
```

##

Most tables need a bit of clean-up:

```{r}
names(tables[[2]])

names(tables[[2]])[1:2] <- c("Rank.Last.Week", "Rank")
str(tables[[2]])
box <- tables[[2]] %>% mutate(
  Gross = parse_number(Gross),
  Thtrs. = parse_number(Thtrs.)
)
head(box)
```

<span style="color:white">Connect to the The-Numbers website for weekly boxoffice gross at https://www.the-numbers.com/weekend-box-office-chart
</span>

- <span style="color:white">Pick the week that you were last in the movies.
</span>
- <span style="color:white">Use `rvest` to download the box office gross in that week.
</span>
- <span style="color:white">Clean up the data (name all the variables, numbers should be numbers).
</span>

## Beyond tables

Sometimes data on the web is not structured as nicely ... e.g. let's assume we want to get a list of all recently active baseball players from [Baseball reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/)

## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

- [css](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) is a language that describes the style of an HTML document.

<img src="images/css-selectors-lrg.png" height=100, width=600>

- Example: (https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_default)
- play [the game](http://flukeout.github.io/)

## SelectorGadget

- SelectorGadget is a javascript bookmarklet to determine the [css](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) selectors of pieces of a website we want to extract.
- Read up on the [SelectorGadget](http://selectorgadget.com/) link: install it for your machine by installing the Chrome extension, then click on it to use it.
- When SelectorGadget is active, pieces of the website are highlighted in orange/green/red.
- Use SelectorGadget on http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/.
- read more details on `vignette("selectorgadget")`

## SelectorGadget Result

```{r}
url <- "http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/"
html <- read_html(url)
html %>% html_nodes("#div_players_ a") %>% head()
```

## Example

We want to get access to pieces of the links:

`html_text` allows us to get text out, `html_attr` let's us access an attribute of an html node, `html_attrs` extracts all attributes of an html node:


```{r}
html %>% html_nodes("#div_players_ a") %>% html_text() %>% head()
html %>% html_nodes("#div_players_ a") %>% html_attr(name="href") %>% head()
```


## How to use the href?

```{r}
h1 = html %>% html_nodes("#div_players_ a") %>% html_attr(name="href")
length(h1)
h1[1]

h0 = "http://www.baseball-reference.com"
url.player = paste(h0, h1[1], sep = "")
url.player
```
