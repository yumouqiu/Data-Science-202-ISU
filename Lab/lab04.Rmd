## Outline

- Find your team members
- Create a repository (one per team) & give access to everybody
- Tidying data (on Avengers' risks)
- Fact checking some FiveThirtyEight statements
- Create an R markdown file that contains all code to read the data and create the plots
- Submit!


# Find your team members

## github repository

1. Log into github 
2. Pick one team member to create a repository called 'lab4'. Make sure to initialize the repo with a README file. 
3. Go into the settings of the repository and add your team members as collaborators

## Cloning the repo

1. Open RStudio, create a new repository using the option "Version Control", choose git as the option
2. From your github repository copy  the info you get when clicking on the green "Clone or download" button
3. Paste the info into "Repository URL"
4. Create the project.

This clones the repository from github. You can now make local changes. 


## Data Background

We are back to data collected by FiveThirtyEight. This time we are interested in a review of life and death among the Avengers, a group of super heroes in the Marvel universe; the accompanying article is published [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/avengers-death-comics-age-of-ultron/)

In a universe where time travel, alternate lifelines and portals with all kinds of powers exist, dying might be less permanent than in the world that we are used to. 

## Data Background (2)

In 2015 FiveThirtyEight has conducted a comprehensive review of all Avengers. We can access the resulting data using the command

```{r}
av <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
av
```

## Part one: Data tidying

The avenger data consists of ten columns for each avenger called Death[1-5] to Return[1-5]

Get the data into a format where the five columns for Death[1-5] are replaced by two columnes: Time, and Death. Time should be a number between 1 and 5 (look into the function `parse_number`); Death is a categorical variables with values "yes", "no" and "". Call the result `deaths`. 

Similarly, deal with the returns of characters.

## Part two: Validation

Each team member picks one of the statements in the FiveThirtyEight [analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/avengers-death-comics-age-of-ultron/) and fact checks it based on the data. Use dplyr functionality whenever possible.

Upload your answers and the code to the repository. Discuss and refine answers as a team.

## Submission

In Canvas, submit an RMarkdown file (and the knitted html document) with: 

  a. the names of all team members that worked on the document.
  b. a link to the github repo you were working in.
  c. code and answers to all of the questions.
  d. you can upload the data file, but you don't have to


Due date: You have time until Monday at 10 pm to submit the final RMmarkdown file.
