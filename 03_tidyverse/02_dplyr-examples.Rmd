# Happy data

## Outline

- cleaning and upgrading the HAPPY data
- working with `group_by` and `summarise`

## The Happy data from GSS

The General Social Survey (GSS) has been run by NORC every other year since 1972 to keep track of current opinions across the United States. 

An excerpt of the GSS data is available from our course website. 
Dowload the file [HAPPY.rds]() and put the file into a folder called "data" next to your Rmd file. The following command is going to load the data into your R session:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
HAPPY <- readRDS("data/HAPPY.rds")
```

You can find a codebook with explanations for each of the variables at https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/

## A first look

```{r}
HAPPY %>% str()
```

## The variable `HAPPY`

```{r}
HAPPY %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = HAPPY)) + geom_bar()
```

## Cleaning up `HAPPY`

- make all strings lowercase: `tolower`
- convert into a factor variable, levels are in right order

```{r}
HAPPY <- HAPPY %>% mutate(
  happy = factor(tolower(HAPPY))
) %>% select(-HAPPY)

head(HAPPY)
```

## Data Cleaning

1. Data cleaning: the values "IAP", "DK" and "NA" all encode missing values. We have to replace all of these instances by the value `NA`. 
2. Check the type of the variable and cast into the right type.
3. Bring all levels of factors into a sensible order. 

## Recoding missing values

Object in `replace` does not have to be a variable, a data frame can also be used:

```{r}
HAPPY <- replace(HAPPY, HAPPY %in% c("IAP", "DK", "NA"), NA)
```

the remaining cleaning is just pretty tedious manual work ...

## The variable `AGE`

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}
HAPPY <- HAPPY %>% mutate(
  age = replace(AGE, AGE == "89 AND OLDER", 89),
  age = as.numeric(age)
) %>% select(-AGE)

HAPPY %>% ggplot(aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
```

## The variable `DEGREE`

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height = 3.5}
HAPPY <- HAPPY %>% mutate(
  degree = factor(tolower(DEGREE)),
  degree = factor(degree, levels=c("lt high school", "high school", "junior college", "bachelor", "graduate school"))
) %>% select(-DEGREE)

HAPPY %>% ggplot(aes(x = degree)) + geom_bar()
```

## Working with `happy`

`happy` data included in the `classdata` package

upgrade the package: `devtools::install_github("heike/classdata")`

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(classdata)
data("happy", package="classdata")
head(happy)
```

## Summarising Happiness

Use scores for `happy` factor to summarise overall happiness level, i.e. `not too happy` = 1, `pretty happy` = 2, and `very happy` = 3

```{r}
happy %>% summarise(
  m.happy = mean(as.numeric(happy), na.rm=TRUE)
  )
```
```{r}
happy %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(
  m.happy = mean(as.numeric(happy), na.rm=TRUE)
  )
```

## Your turn: group_by and summarise {.white}

<span style="color:white">For this your turn use the `happy` data from the `classdata` package </span>

- <span style="color:white">How do average happiness levels change over age?</span>
- <span style="color:white">Are Republicans or Democrats happier? Compare average happiness levels over `partyid`.</span>
- <span style="color:white">How are financial relations associated with average happiness levels? Is this association different for men and women?</span><br><br>
- <span style="color:white">Find a plot that shows the differences for each one of the summaries.</span>

## Your turn: asking questions {.white}

<span style="color:white">For this your turn use the `happy` data from the `classdata` package </span>

- <span style="color:white">Investigate what other variable(s) might be associated with happiness. Plot it.</span>

## Helper functions (1)

- `n()` provides the number of rows of a subset:
```{r}
happy %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(n = n())
```
- `tally()` is a combination of `summarise` and `n`
```{r}
happy %>% group_by(sex) %>% tally()
```

## Helper functions (2)

- `count()` is a further shortcut of `group_by` and `tally`:
```{r}
happy %>% count(sex, degree)
```
