## French fries data

```{r}
data(french_fries, package="reshape2")
```

- data from sensory experiment conducted at Iowa State University in 2004
- investigators were interested in comparing effects of three different fryer oils on taste of fries

```{r}
french_fries %>% head()
```

## Did the french fries taste worse over time?

> - How do we define 'tasting well'? 
>   - Higher values of potato-y and buttery, lower values of grassy, rancid, painty
> - Compute averages of these scales for each time point
> - combination of `group_by` and `summarise`

## Did the french fries taste worse over time? (2)

```{r}
french_fries %>% group_by(time) %>% summarise(
  m.potato = mean(potato, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.buttery = mean(buttery, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.grassy = mean(grassy, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.rancid = mean(rancid, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.painty = mean(painty, na.rm=TRUE)
) %>% head()
```

## Did the french fries taste worse over time? (3)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

avgs <- french_fries %>% group_by(time) %>% summarise(
  m.potato = mean(potato, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.buttery = mean(buttery, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.grassy = mean(grassy, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.rancid = mean(rancid, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.painty = mean(painty, na.rm=TRUE)
)
```

```{r}
avgs %>% ggplot(aes(x = time)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = m.potato)) +
  geom_point(shape=2, aes(y=m.rancid)) + 
  ylab("Average")
```
