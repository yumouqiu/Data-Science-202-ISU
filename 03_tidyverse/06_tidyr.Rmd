# Messy (2)

## separate

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- data.frame(x = c("a.b", "a.d", "b.c", NA))
df
df %>% separate(x, into = c("A", "B"))
```

## Your Turn (5 min)


The Iowa Data Portal is a wealth of information on and about the State of Iowa. 

The website 
[Campaign Expenditures](https://data.iowa.gov/Government/Campaign-Expenditures/3adi-mht4/data) provides data on campaign expenditures. The code below reads the data into an R session.


```
url <- "https://data.iowa.gov/api/views/3adi-mht4/rows.csv"
campaign <- readr::read_csv(url)
```

Assess the 'messiness' of the data. List issues that prevent us from working with the data directly. Which of these issues are of type (1) or (2) of messiness?

## Problems with the data

- `Date` is text, in the format of Month/Day/Year (Messy 2)
- city coordinates are a combination of City name, state, zip code and geographic latitude and longitude. (Messy 2)
- expenditure amount is a textual expression, not a number (Messy different)

no Messy 1? - problems of type Messy 1 are typically hard to detect and often up to interpretation/dependent on the analysis to be done.

- Check the help for the function `parse_number` in the `readr` package and use it on the campaign expenditure data.
- Use `separate` to split the date variable into year, month and day.
- Use `separate` again to extract geographic latitude and longitude (Hint - you might need several steps of `separate`)
- Using `dplyr` functionality answer the following questions:

  1. What is the total amount of campaign expenditure?
  2. What is the single largest cost in the campaign expenditures?
  3. What time frame does the campaign expenditure cover?
  4. Plot geographic longitude and latitude. Do campaign expenditures stay in the State of IA? Investigate oddities.
