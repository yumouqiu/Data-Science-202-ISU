## Keywords: which function is it?


- `mutate`: introduce, replace, reorder, ...
- `summarise`: calculate, average, summary, ...
- `group_by`: for each of, 
- `filter`: exclude, only consider, ...

## Potential traps

- using the $ notation in tidyverse can lead to strange behavior and error messages
- don't forget to save statements back into the dataset (`mutate`, `arrange`) or  new data objects (`summarise`, `filter`)
- when using the pipe `%>%`: what is output from lhs, first parameter on rhs?

## French fries data

```{r}
data(french_fries, package="reshape2")
```

- data from sensory experiment conducted at Iowa State University in 2004
- investigators were interested in comparing effects of three different fryer oils on taste of fries

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(classdata)
```

```{r}
french_fries %>% head()
```

## Did the french fries taste worse over time?

> - How do we define 'tasting well'? 
> - Higher values of potato-y and buttery, lower values of grassy, rancid, painty
> - Compute averages of these scales for each time point
> - combination of `group_by` and `summarise`

## Did the french fries taste worse over time? (2)

```{r}
french_fries %>% group_by(time) %>% summarise(
  m.potato = mean(potato, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.buttery = mean(buttery, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.grassy = mean(grassy, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.rancid = mean(rancid, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.painty = mean(painty, na.rm=TRUE)
) %>% head()
```

## Did the french fries taste worse over time? (3)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

avgs <- french_fries %>% group_by(time) %>% summarise(
  m.potato = mean(potato, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.buttery = mean(buttery, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.grassy = mean(grassy, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.rancid = mean(rancid, na.rm=TRUE),
  m.painty = mean(painty, na.rm=TRUE)
)
```

```{r}
avgs %>% ggplot(aes(x = time)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = m.potato)) +
  geom_point(shape=2, aes(y=m.rancid)) + 
  ylab("Average")
```


## Your turn {.white}

<span style="color:white">For this your turn use the `french_fries` data from the `reshape2` package: `data(french_fries, package="reshape2")` </span>

- <span style="color:white">Do ratings of potato-y show a difference between the different oils over time?</span>
- <span style="color:white">Draw a plot of the average potato-y rating by time, color by treatment.</span>
- <span style="color:white">How does this plot look like for the rancid rating?</span>
