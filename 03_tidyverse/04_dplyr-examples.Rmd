## Keywords: which function is it?


- `mutate`: introduce, replace, reorder, ...
- `summarise`: calculate, average, summary, ...
- `group_by`: for each of, 
- `filter`: exclude, only consider, ...

## Potential traps

- using the $ notation in tidyverse can lead to strange behavior and error messages
- don't forget to save statements back into the dataset (`mutate`, `arrange`) or  new data objects (`summarise`, `filter`)
- when using the pipe `%>%`: what is output from lhs, first parameter on rhs?
