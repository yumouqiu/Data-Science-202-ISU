# Factor variables

## Factors


- A special type of variable to indicate categories
- both *labels* and their *order* (i.e. numbers) 
- By default text variables are stored in factors during input
- numeric categorical variables have to be converted to factors manually
- `factor` creates a new factor with specified labels



## Your Turn {.white}

<img class="cover" src="images/blue.jpeg" alt="" width=2000>

- <span style="color:white">Inspect the `fbi` object. How many variables are there? Which type does each of the variables have?</span>
- <span style="color:white">Make a summary of Year</span>
- <span style="color:white">Make Year  a factor variable: `fbi$Year <- factor(fbi$Year)`</span>
- <span style="color:white">Compare summary of Year to the previous result</span>
- <span style="color:white">Are there other variables that should be factors (or vice versa)? </span>

```{r}
dim(fbi)

summary(fbi$Year)

fbi$Year.factor = factor(fbi$Year)

summary(fbi$Year.factor)

```

## Note: factors in boxplots

boxplots in ggplot2 only work properly if the x variable is a character variable or a factor:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(classdata)
```

```{r}
twoyear <- dplyr::filter(fbi, Year %in% c(1961, 2014))
```

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = twoyear, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_boxplot()
```
</p>
<p class="double-flow">
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = twoyear, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Count)) + geom_boxplot()
```
</p>

</div>

## Data types: checking and casting

Checking for, and casting between types: 

- `str`, `mode` provide info on type
- `is.XXX` (with XXX either `factor, int, numeric, logical, character, ...` ) checks for specific type
- `as.XXX` casts to specific type


## Casting between types

![](images/casting.png)
**Note:** `as.numeric` applied to a factor retrieves *order* of labels, not labels, even if those could be interpreted as numbers.

To get the labels of a factor as numbers, first cast to character and then to a number.

## Levels of factor variables

- `levels(x)` shows us the levels of factor variable `x` in their current order
- factor variables often have to be re-ordered for ease of comparisons
- We can specify the order of the levels by explicitly listing them, see `help(factor)`
- We can make the order of the levels in one variable dependent on the summary statistic of another variable


## Reordering factor levels - manual

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
fbi$Type = factor(fbi$Type)
levels(fbi$Type)
```

manually (extremely sensitive to typos):

```{r}
levels(factor(fbi$Type, levels=c("Larceny.theft", "Burglary", "Motor.vehicle.theft", "Aggravated.assault", "Robbery", "Legacy.rape", "Murder.and.nonnegligent.Manslaughter", "Rape")))
```

## What will happen if there are typos?

```{r}
temp = factor(fbi$Type, levels=c("Larceny.theft", "Burglary", "Motor.vehicle.theft", "Aggravated.assault", "Robbery", "Legacy.rape", "murder.and.nonnegligent.Manslaughter", "Rape"))
levels(temp)
unique(temp)
```

## Reordering factor levels - using another variable

`reorder(factor, numbers, function)`

reorder levels in factor by values in `numbers`. Use `function` to summarise (average is used by default). 

```{r}
levels(reorder(fbi$Type, fbi$Count, na.rm=TRUE))
```

missing values in `numbers`? make sure to use parameter `na.rm=TRUE`!

## Your turn {.white}

<img class="cover" src="images/blue.jpeg" alt="" width=2000>

<span style="color:white">For this your turn use the `fbi` object from the `classdata` package. </span>

- <span style="color:white">Introduce a rate of the number of reported offenses by population into the `fbi` data. You could use the *Ames standard* to make values comparable to a city of the size of Ames (population ~70,000).</span>
- <span style="color:white">
Plot boxplots of crime rates by different types of crime. How can you make axis text legible? </span>
- <span style="color:white">
Reorder the boxplots of crime rates, such that the boxplots are ordered by their medians. </span>
- <span style="color:white">
For one type of crime (`subset` or `filter`) plot boxplots of rates by state, reorder boxplots by median crime rates</span>


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
fbi$Crime.rate = fbi$Count / fbi$Population * 70000
ggplot(data = fbi, aes(x = Type, y = Crime.rate)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()

fbi1 = fbi
fbi1$Type = factor(fbi1$Type)
levels(fbi1$Type)
levels(fbi1$Type)[c(1, 5, 6)] = c("Assault", "MV.theft", "Murder")
ggplot(data = fbi1, aes(x = Type, y = Crime.rate)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()

fbi2 = fbi1
fbi2$Type = factor(fbi2$Type, levels = levels(reorder(fbi1$Type, fbi1$Crime.rate, median, na.rm=TRUE)))
ggplot(data = fbi2, aes(x = Type, y = Crime.rate)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()

fbi3 = dplyr::filter(fbi, Type == "Burglary")
mode(fbi3$State)
fbi3$State = factor(fbi3$State)
fbi3$State = factor(fbi3$State, levels = levels(reorder(fbi3$State, fbi3$Crime.rate, median, na.rm=TRUE)))
ggplot(data = fbi3, aes(x = State, y = Crime.rate)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()
```

## Changing Levels' names

```{r}
fbi$Type = factor(fbi$Type)
levels(fbi$Type)
```

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)[6] = "Murder"

levels(fbi$Type)
```
